## Key Features & Benefits (Inferred)

Based on the project structure, the app likely provides the following features:

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using `signin_page` and potentially a `login_page_provider`.
*   **Expense Tracking:**  Manages and tracks individual and shared expenses.  This is suggested by the presence of models like `debts_model.dart` and `payment_model.dart`.
*   **Debt Management:** Allows roommates to track debts and payments to each other.
*   **Financial Overview:** Provides a summary of financial data, potentially displayed using charts (indicated by `chart icon.svg`).
*   **Net Payment Calculation:** Calculates net payments owed between users (likely handled by `netPayments` page and `net_payment_page_provider`).
*   **User Profiles:**  Manages user profiles, likely through a `user_model.dart`.
*   **Notifications:**  Provides notifications to users (related to finance tracking).

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

*   **API Service (`lib/api/api_service.dart`):** This file likely contains functions for interacting with an external API. Examine the code to understand the available endpoints and data structures.

*   **State Management (`lib/state`):** The application utilizes Providers for state management. Refer to the files within the `lib/state` directory for specifics on how state is managed for the login page, main page, and net payments page.

## Configuration Options

*   **API Endpoints:** The base URL for the API can potentially be found and modified in `lib/api/api_service.dart`.

*   **Constants:** The file `lib/constants/const.dart` likely contains configurable constants such as theme colors, fonts, and other application-wide settings.
